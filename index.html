            Welcome to my page!
            </br>
            </br>
            My name is Richard Tran! I am a software developer, and recent <strong>Computer Science</strong> graduate of <strong>Rutgers University</strong>. 
            I began my career back in my 3rd year of high school in 2010 after I took an Intro to Computer Science class and used Java for my projects. I instantly
            enjoyed every aspect of it, and decided to compete in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.acsl.org">American Computer Science League</a> competition
            the next year. I managed to make it to <strong>second place</strong> regionally, and got a chance to compete against teams from Asia, Europe, and Africa. 
            It is still one of the best experiences I've ever had as I got to collaborate with people from different parts of the world, 
            and understand the importance of communication with your team to solve difficult problems.
            </br>
            </br>
            Most recently, I finished a summer internship at Prudential Financial as an <strong>Internal Web Developer</strong> for the Annuities Database
            Administration (DBA) team. My task was to create a web application tool that allowed the team to adjust their on-call schedule,
            and give other departments read-only access. In addition, the web application pulled in usage data from different servers such as current CPU, memory,
            hard drive space, and more. This significantly reduced the amount of time spent pulling this data manually through remote access, or database clients.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the same summer, I was also hired as a summer <strong>research assistant</strong> to research the benefits and optimizations of using nVidia GPUs to process 
            existing graph search algorithms rather than traditional CPUs. Using C++, I developed code to scan through nVidia CUDA assembly code that was already
            compiled from a written graph search (also the baseline), and rearrange both instruction sets, as well as virtual to physical register mapping.

                  A fun virtual reality game where you race to take down an aerial blimp, and collect coins on the way.
                  This project was built with Unity-3D, Oculus DK2 API, C#, and using the Oculus Rift DK2 hardware to control 
                  steering using both yaw, and roll of your head. All rotational axes of a human user is used 
                  to aim the crosshair.

                  Project written in Java. This project rearranges ILOC instruction sets into a new set that optimally uses all
                  available registers without affecting desired output. Used data structures including Hash Maps.
                  Trees, ArrayLists, and Objects to accomplish such simulation of a real assembly scheduler 
                  that runs in a reasonable amount of time.
